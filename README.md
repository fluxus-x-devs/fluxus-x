## Tips for Safer Use

Using any Roblox executor carries risk. These best practices can help reduce it:

- 🧩 **Use trusted scripts only.** Avoid random pastebin links. Stick to reputable script hubs and communities.  
- 👤 **Avoid your main account.** Use an alternate Roblox account for testing and heavy scripting.  
- ⚙️ **Enable safety options.** Use humanized delays, disable overly aggressive scripts, and avoid obvious features like blatant one-hit kills.  
- 🔄 **Keep Fluxus X updated.** Always run the latest **fluxus executor v6** build so the anti-detection layer stays current.  
- 📡 **Do not use in competitive ranked modes.** Focus on casual, non-ranked experiences to minimize reporting.  
- 🚫 **Respect game creators.** Excessive abuse can harm communities and increase ban waves.  
- 🔒 **Secure your device.** Keep your OS, antivirus, and browser secure to avoid malware disguised as scripts.

> ❗ **No tool can guarantee 0% ban risk.** Use Fluxus X responsibly and at your own discretion.
